  const response = `I understand you want to generate a Mermaid diagram. Here's a sample response that would be generated by analyzing your codebase:

Based on your repository structure, I can see you have a Next.js application with TypeScript. Here's a component architecture diagram:

\`\`\`mermaid
graph TD
    A[App Layout] --> B[Page Component]
    B --> C[Left Panel]
    B --> D[Right Panel]
    C --> E[Assistant Tab]
    C --> F[Directory Tab]
    C --> G[Repositories Tab]
    D --> H[Mermaid Viewer]
    D --> I[CodeMirror Editor]
    E --> J[AI Chat Interface]
    F --> K[File Tree Navigator]
    G --> L[Repository List]
\`\`\`

This diagram shows the main component hierarchy of your Siren application. Would you like me to generate a more detailed diagram focusing on a specific aspect of your codebase?`;
